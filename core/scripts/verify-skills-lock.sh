# Exit codes:
#   0 — all skills match the lockfile
#   1 — drift detected (skill content differs from lock) or missing files
#   2 — cannot read lockfile or missing dependency (jq)
#
# Intended usage:
#   - Run manually before trusting a shipped template.
#   - Wire into CI to detect accidental skill edits that should have bumped the lock.
